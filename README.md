# ðŸš¢ Titanic Survival Prediction - Machine Learning & Streamlit App

This project predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning. Built as part of my internship at CodSoft, the project uses data preprocessing, model training, and a deployed interactive web app using Streamlit.
